          <h3>What If Something Happens To My Media?</h3>
          <p>
          While we take extraordinary care of all media, due to the age and unknown method in which the media was stored, we do not take responsibility for any damaged media.
          <strong> There is always a risk associated with playback and by using our service, you accept that risk. </strong>
          We will not hold you responsible for any damage to our equipment caused by failed media.

        <div className="question">
          <h3>What If My Tape Is Blank?</h3>
          <p>Unless told otherwise, I will not digitize tapes that appear to be blank - no content in the first 2 minutes of the tape - there will be no charge for that tape. I will put those tapes aside and contact you to see If you'd like to be sure there is not content in the middle or the end of the tape. 

I will also digitize the entire tape, even if there is only a few minutes of content at the beginning. I will trim the final file down if there is no content, but this will make sure something doesn't pop up at the end of the tape. </p>
        </div>

        <div className="question">
          <h3>Is There Content You Won't Digitize</h3>
          <p>

I cannot digitize any commercial content or content that depicts violence to people or animals or represents views and values not consistent with my own.
